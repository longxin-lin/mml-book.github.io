We wrote a book on Mathematics for Machine Learning that motivates people to learn mathematical concepts. The book is not intended to cover advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty of books doing this. Instead, we aim to provide the necessary mathematical skills to read those other books.

The book will be [published by Cambridge University Press](https://www.cambridge.org/au/academic/subjects/computer-science/pattern-recognition-and-machine-learning/mathematics-machine-learning?format=PB&isbn=9781108455145) in early 2020.

We split the book into two parts:

* Mathematical foundations
* Example machine learning algorithms that use the mathematical foundations

We aim to keep this book fairly short, so we don't cover everything.

**We will keep PDFs of this book freely available after publication.**

### [Report errata and feedback](https://github.com/mml-book/mml-book.github.io/issues).

We submitted the final draft for copy-editing. Therefore, any issues you raise now may not make it into the printed version.

## Tutorials
We are working on jupyter notebook tutorials for the machine learning parts:

1. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/mml-book/mml-book.github.io/tree/master/tutorials/tutorial_linear_regression.ipynb)
2. [Gaussian Mixture Models](tutorials/tutorial_gmm.ipynb)
3. [PCA](tutorials/tutorial_pca.ipynb)
4. SVM (work in progress)
